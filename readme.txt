Replacing db.json
    The db.json file contains the menu data used by the app. To replace it with your own data, follow these steps:

    Create a JSON file with your menu data. The structure should be similar to the existing db.json file. Here's an example:    

            {
        "dishes": [
            {
            "id": 11,
            "name": "Your Dish 1",
            "description": "Description of Your Dish 1",
            "price": 19.99,
            "image": "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=YourDish1",
            "ingredients": [
                "Ingredient 1",
                "Ingredient 2",
                "Ingredient 3"
            ],
            "tags": {
                "dietaryPreferences": ["vegan", "gluten-free"],
                "allergens": []
            }
            },
            {
            "id": 12,
            "name": "Your Dish 2",
            "description": "Description of Your Dish 2",
            "price": 14.99,
            "image": "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=YourDish2",
            "ingredients": [
                "Ingredient A",
                "Ingredient B",
                "Ingredient C"
            ],
            "tags": {
                "dietaryPreferences": ["vegetarian", "lactose-free"],
                "allergens": []
            }
            },
            // Add more dishes as needed
        ]
        }
    Save your new JSON file as db.json.

    Replace the existing db.json file in the project's root directory with your newly created db.json.

    Restart the development server by running:
        npm start

    Your menu data should now be loaded and displayed in the app.

    Understanding the Code
        The Restaurant Menu App is built using React and JavaScript. Here's an overview of the important files and directories:

        src/MenuItemDetails.js: This component displays the details of a selected menu item.

        src/db.json: The JSON file containing the menu data. Replace this file to update the menu items.

        src/logo.png: The logo image displayed in the app.

        public/: This directory contains static assets and the HTML template for the app.

        package.json: Contains project metadata and dependencies.

        README.txt: The README file you are currently reading.
